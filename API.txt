in my react app i would love to put a movie page for all movies. basically when you click on the movie box , it takes you here http://localhost:3000/film/scrapper-2023/. e.g for the movie scrapper. how do i organize my react app to to do this. in terms of creating components and stuff  


const videos = {
  results: [
    // ... (your video objects here)
  ]
};

const firstTrailer = videos.results.find(video => video.type === "Trailer");

if (firstTrailer) {
  console.log(firstTrailer);
} else {
  console.log("No trailer found with type 'Trailer'");
}
